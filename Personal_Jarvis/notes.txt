TODO:
    [] create a function that checks if device is connected to internet first
    [] get account for AI service for the long run
    [] find a way where the code will go to the sight and go into inspect and find the api key when its running or every 24hrs(might not need)
    [] find a way for it to control smart devices

Issue 1 : 
    I was not able to excute scripts for whatever reason and need to excute this command so that i would be able 
    execute scripts and enter into my venv.

            Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

Issue 2:
    the way i get the API key seems to not work for long term. it seems to reset after a while and i need to get another one.
    to get the API key :
        1. go to https://bard.google.com/
        2. right click and inspect 
        3. in the inspect window go to "Application"
        4. look for "Cookies" in the "Storage" section 
        5. click on https://bard.google.com/
        6. under "Name" look for "__Secure-1PSID" and click on it 
        7. in the "Cookie Value" section that is the API key

Issue 3.
    tryin to check internet connection. the import brains check the api ket with google bard and if it cannot 
    get a connection then the program throws a error and the program terminates.

Version Notes:
    jarvis-v1_0 : 
        a simple project that allows the use of Google bard with voice activation.
        it looks for a keyword specified and then starts recording audio so that it can be transcribed to be turn into a 
        input for the query of Google Bard. it then sends that query to google bard and google bard will give back a response
        in the terminal window.

    jarvis-v2_0 :
